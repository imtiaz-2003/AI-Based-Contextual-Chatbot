# AI-Based-Contextual-Chatbot

Python Chatbot Project:
So in this Chatbot project, we are going to make an AI-based contextual chatbot that will maintain the context or in which sense or proportion the user is asking a query. Further using deep learning techniques in Python, we will construct a Sequential model for our training sets of data. The intents, patterns, and responses will all be used to train the chatbot. The user’s query will be mapped to the intents class using neural networks, which will maintain context and then return a random response.

Prerequisites for Python Deep Learning Chatbot project:
Modules required: nltk, pickle, tensorflow, numpy, sklearn

The dataset for python chatbot project will be ‘intents.json’. This file contains the required patterns we need to find and corresponding responses we want to return to the end users.
